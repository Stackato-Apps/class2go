<h1>Class2Go</h1>

<p>Class2Go is Stanford's internal platform for on-line courses. We began
building Class2Go in June 2012. A team of eight has worked on it through
the summer. It will launch in Fall 2012 to host a handful of internal
and open Stanford classes.</p>

<p>Class2Go is intended to be an open platform for learning and research.
Professors will have direct access to the data for their classes
to learn how their students learn. We will facilitate experiments.
This could be A/B/N testing of how different things affect student
learning, or even bespoke code to try out interesting new features.</p>

<h2>Philosophy </h2>

<p>Here is what is important to us.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Open</em>. The platform is open source to make it easier for users
(faculty members) to give us feedback on what we are doing.
We would love to have others use the platform, or
to collaborate with similar efforts in other places.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Portable</em>. We believe strongly that valuable course content
shouldn't be tied to any one platform. Documents are already
portable; the videos are outside our system (on YouTube) and
the assets themselves can be repurposed as faculty see fit.
And our exercises and problem sets, instead of being trapped
in a proprietary database, are in the Khan Academy format, so
they can be used elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Interoperable</em>. We don't want to build or maintain more than we
have to. See the section below for a list of all the shoulders
we are standing on.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<p>To bring this to life we've built a system. Here are some of its
important and distinguishing features.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Video and Problem Set Management</em>. Professors (and TA's) can
upload assets to S3; videos are then uploaded to YouTube.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Exercises</em>. We support two kinds of exercises: formative (for
learning) and summative (for assessment, like quizzes and tests).
Students can attempt each problem as many times as they want
without penalty in formative problem sets, but may be penalized
for multiple submissions in summative sets. In both types of
problem sets, feedback is available immediately so students can
learn along the way.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Content Management</em>. We have built a simple content management
system where course information (videos, static pages, problem
sets) can be created, reviewed, and then published. One important
ability is an automatic live date, so a professor (or, most
likely, a TA) doesn't have to click a button at midnight to
publish a problem set.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Frame Extraction</em>. We have a tool for extracting frames from
a video (using <code>ffmpeg</code>) differencing them to find key
frames, and then using thumbnails of these frames as an index
to the video. It's called the Kelvinator after its author,
Kelvin Do.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Leveraging Others</h2>

<p>Thanks to all the projects we are relying on to make this work. Some
commercial, some open source. But a ton of good stuff.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> for video</li>
<li><a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> for their HTML-based exercise framework</li>
<li><a href="http://www.piazza.com/">Piazza</a> for forums</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mysql.org/">MySQL</a> is our database</li>
<li>The massive <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> ecosystem: eg. South, Registration</li>
<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon AWS</a> suite for hosting (EC2, S3, RDS, Route53, IAM)</li>
<li>Chef from <a href="http://www.opscode.org/">Opscode</a> for configuration management</li>
<li><a href="http://www.github.com/">Github</a> for source code management and issues</li>
</ul>
