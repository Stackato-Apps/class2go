Usage: ./kelvinator [input video file] [frames rate] [difference threshold]

- input video file: name of video to extract frames from ex. sample_iTunes.mov

  If the input file begins with "s3://" then we will use the s3cmd to sync
  the file down to a temp directory under /opt/class2go, do the procesing
  there, and then use s3cmd to sync the manifest and jpegs back up

- frame rate: number of frames to extract per second ex. 1 = 1 frame every
  second, 5 = 5 frames every second, .1 = 1 frame every 10 seconds

- difference threshold: value to measure how different two frames
  are. larger value means greater difference. larger value passed means
  fewer frames will be kept

Requirements for usage:
	ffmpeg must be installed
    PIL must be installed
